# Emap

A monorepo for all core Emap functions

# Setup

See the [instructions for deploying an instance of EMAP](docs/dev/core.md).

You should end up with the following directory structure.

```
EMAP [your root emap directory]
├── config [config files passed to docker containers, not in any repo]
├── hoover [different repo]
├── emap [this repo]
│   ├── emap-star         [ formerly Inform-DB repo ]
│   ├── emap-interchange  [ formerly Emap-Interchange repo ]
│   ├── hl7-reader        [ formerly emap-hl7-processor repo ]
│   ├── core              [ formerly Emap-Core repo ]
│   ├── [etc.]
```

## Developer onboarding

- How to [configure IntelliJ](docs/dev/intellij.md) to build emap and run tests.
- [Onboarding](docs/dev/onboarding.md) gives details on how data items are processed and the test strategies used.


# Monorepo migration

How were [old repos migrated into this repo?](docs/dev/migration.md)


# Branching strategy

`main` should always be usable in production, having gone through a validation run as well as the "standard" checks
of code review and GHA tests using synthetic data.

The `develop` branch is a pre-release branch intended to bring together one or more PRs. The standard checks
 are performed when merging into here, but we can delay the full validation run until we're ready to merge to `main`.
