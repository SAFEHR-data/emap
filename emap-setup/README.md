# emap-setup

Code to initialise, update and run EMAP. Includes ability to:
1. Clone repos if they don't exist
2. Set up configuration
3. Run pipeline (live and validation runs)
4. Update code (`git pull`)


## Usage: GAE

`emap-setup` should be installed on each deployment of emap, this is created 
from the directory for the EMAP deployment:

```shell
python -m venv venv --prompt "."
```

This can then be activated by running

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

The required `global-configuration.yaml` files exist in schema specific folders
e.g. `/gae/emap-<schema name>`.

## Usage: Local

1. Create your top-level working directory 
1. Clone emap into that directory
1. Install the emap setup package to a virtual environment
1. Copy global-configuration-EXAMPLE.yaml as global-configuration.yaml to the top top-level working directory  
   and adjust for your own requirements

For example, create and activate a virtual environment first with either:

<details><summary>Conda</summary>

```bash
conda create python=3.9 -n emap --yes &&\
conda activate emap
```

</details>
<details><summary>venv</summary>

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/venvs/emap &&\
python -m venv ~/.local/venvs/emap &&\
source ~/.local/venvs/emap/bin/activate
```

</details>

then clone and install 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UCLH-DHCT/emap
cd emap-setup
pip install -e . -r requirements.txt
cp global-configuration-EXAMPLE.yaml ../../global-configuration.yaml
```
